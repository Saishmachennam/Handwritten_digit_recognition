# Handwritten_digit_recognition
Designed and implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. Utilized Python and TensorFlow for model development, achieving over 98% accuracy through effective data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization.
